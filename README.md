# CNC-remote-for-Buildbotics-controller
CNC remote for Buildbotics and Onefinity controller

You may use it for your own project as long as it is non-commercial. Feel free to create your own project with it. Adjust it for your own needs. Even with hardware I didn't provide. But you may not create a commercial product with it. If you have great ideas to improve the firmware, let me know. Or code it yourself, and I might merge it.
